Functional shell scripts | Spencer Tipping

These scripts provide a functional shell environment. This gives you the ability
to use constructs similar to those in functional programming languages, but on
the shell level.

This project is uninspired at present and needs ideas.

Examples:

ls | each echo _                                        # The same as ls
ls | each cat _                                         # Concatenates everything in this directory
ls | each 'ln -s _ _.txt'                               # Symlinks each file as file.txt
ls | each 'ln -s _ $(md5sum _ | awk "{print \$1}")'     # Symlinks each file as the MD5 of its contents
ls | each 'test -f _ && echo _ || :'                    # Only print regular files
ls | each 'echo _ $(($(wc -c < _) / $(wc -l < _)))'     # Display characters per line for each file
